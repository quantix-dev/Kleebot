# Kleebot - Dev Branch
# THIS BOT IS NOW DEPRECATED, A NEW VERSION IS IN PRODUCTION

## What is kleebot?
Kleebot is a simple bot that I am using to train and sculpt my discord.js skills.
I am using kleebot as a way of testing my new findings and experiments.

## Why is it on github?
If I am learning from coding kleebot why not let everyone else learn! So for this fact I am officially
putting it on github (previously privated) so everyone can learn and possibly help?

### Before you go ahead and host this bot it has a license under the GPL please remember to read it.
